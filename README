Make sure your /etc/asterisk/manager.conf already has this line:
#include manager_custom.conf

Then copy the included manager_custom.conf to the same directory (/etc/asterisk/)
on your Asterisk server.

Note: Do not forget to modify this file with the IP Address of your XBMC.
Note2: I assume your Asterisk server is reachable with hostname asterisk. Otherwise, use its IP address.

All this is required for the XBMC scripts to be able to communicate with Asterisk.

Then, restart Asterisk and start testing!
