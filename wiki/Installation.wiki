= Introduction =

This addon has two components:
  * A frontend, which runs on XBMC as a Program Addon;
  * A backend, which runs on the Asterisk server as the Asterisk itself and as PHP component;

= XBMC: Frontend Installation =

== Via zip file ==
  # Download latest version from here: [http://code.google.com/p/xbmc-pbx-addon/downloads/list]
  # Go to XBMCs Addon Browser: System -> Add-ons -> Install from zip file 


= Asterisk: Backend Installation =

== Move files around ==
{{{
josh-laptop$cd ~/.xbmc/addons/script.xbmc-pbx-addon/
}}}
Using your favorite FTP program move the folder server_side to your PBX.

== PBX Time ==
  # Put the xbmc-pbx-addon.php somewhere you can access it from a browser.
  # Using a standard install of FreePBX and Asterisk I did not have to change any values in the php file.
  # Add the values you want from manager_custom.conf to /etc/asterisk/manager.conf 
  # Add the information from extensions_custom.conf.sample to your own extensions_custom.conf *DO NOT OVERWRITE THAT* That should be located /etc/asterisk/extensions_custom.conf
  # (optional) To stop Fail2Ban from banning XBMC while setting it up set ignoreip = [IP OF XBMC] in /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf

== Reboot PBX ==
Alternatively:
{{{
root-pbx$amportal restart
root-pbx$service fail2ban restart
}}}

= Addon Configuration =

== Setup Values in XBMC ==
  # This should be under "Programs" and then "Addons"
  # Be very careful to put the correct values for AMI (the ones you put in manager.conf) and set the server to the correct IP address, as well as the correct web address.
