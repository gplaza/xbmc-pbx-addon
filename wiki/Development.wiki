== Possible Features ==

There are two types of interactions with Asterisk:

 * Real Time
  * Initiating Asterisk phone calls through XBMC
   * Communication would be handled by an internal extension you define
   * This could be useful for call-backs to missed calls, voicemails, or just initiating a new phone calls
  * Displaying incoming Asterisk phone call info into XBMC
   * i.e. Caller-ID
  * Actions based on incoming Asterisk phone calls
   * i.e. XBMC could be muted, paused, etc
   * i.e. Asterisk could reject/park/voicemail phone calls if you are watching a movie, etc
 * Historical
  * Access CDR information
   * Information should be shown as a List
  * Access Voicemail recordings
   * Playback through XBMC player
   * Voicemail username and password would need to be previously configured
  * Access received FAXes
  * Display FAXes though XBMC image viewer

== Real Time interaction with Asterisk ==

 * Using Asterisk Manager Interface (AMI)
  * http://www.voip-info.org/wiki/view/Asterisk+manager+API
 * Could take advantage of the existing Python Asterisk package:
  * http://code.google.com/p/py-asterisk/

== Historical Asterisk information ==

 * Would need a PHP page acting as a WebService in order to provide access to:
  * Stored CDR info
  * VoiceMail audio files
  * FAX files
 * Could take advantage of existing projects using PHP code, such as FreePBX

== To Do ==

 * Start testing the real-time Asterisk interaction from XBMC
 * Start searching for PHP libraries or existing code that can provide us the base for historical Asterisk information access
 * Write and publish some working examples
