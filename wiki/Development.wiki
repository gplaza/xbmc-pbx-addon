#summary Documentation used for all Development phases: Requirements, Design and Implementation.
#labels Phase-Requirements,Phase-Design,Phase-Implementation

= Requirements =

 * Display Asterisk CDR and VoiceMail information into XBMC
 * VoiceMail playback through XBMC
 * XBMC actions on Asterisk incoming phone calls
 * Optional:
  * Initiating phone calls
  * Display FAXes into XBMC
  * Asterisk actions based on XBMC status

= Design =

== Possible interaction methods ==

There are two types of interactions with Asterisk:

 * Real Time
  * Initiating Asterisk phone calls through XBMC
   * Communication would be handled by an internal extension and context you define
   * This could be useful for call-backs to missed calls, voicemails, or just initiating a new phone call
  * Displaying incoming Asterisk phone call info into XBMC
   * i.e. Caller-ID popup notification (configurable)
  * Actions based on incoming Asterisk phone calls
   * i.e. XBMC could be muted, paused, etc (configurable)
   * i.e. Asterisk could reject/park/voicemail phone calls if you are watching a movie, etc (configurable(
 * Historical
  * Access CDR information
   * Information should be shown as a List
  * Access Voicemail recordings
   * Information should be shown as a List
   * Playback through XBMC player
   * Voicemail mailbox would need to be previously configured
  * Access received FAXes
   * Display FAXes though XBMC image viewer


= Implementation =

== Real Time interaction with Asterisk ==

 * Develop incoming and outgoing call handlers *- done*
 * Use Asterisk Manager Interface (AMI)
  * http://www.voip-info.org/wiki/view/Asterisk+manager+API
  * http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9780596517342/asterisk-AMI.html
 * Take advantage of the existing Python Asterisk package:
  * http://code.google.com/p/py-asterisk/

== Interact with Historical Asterisk information ==

 * Develop a PHP page acting as a WebService in order to provide access to:
  * Stored CDR info *- done*
  * VoiceMail info and audio files *- done*
  * FAX files
 * Take advantage of existing code, such as:

  * http://wiki.xbmc.org/index.php?title=Python_Development
